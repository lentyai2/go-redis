## TF NOTES

1. There's gotta be a way to reuse the same connection and just change the DB, but I couldn't find it
2. I can use the json file to read the input, but I figured it wasn't a point of this exercise
3. There's gotta be a more efficient way of doing this, but it's all I could come up with for now
